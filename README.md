# GLEngine
Just a little OpenGL abstraction I like to use in my other projects. Architecture heavily inspired by VTK. Use the CMakeLists.txt to build the shared library.
Currently utilizes OpenGL, GLEW, GLM, Eigen, and Assimp.

OpenGL for rendering

GLEW to talk to OpenGL

GLM for convienent math

Assimp for scene loading

Eigen for various maths (spare martices, linear solvers, etc)
